## Todos
Bundle as standalone software
  - timestamps.dat and config should be in a relative path somehow

Improve error handling. No unwrap() or expects()!

Improve the looks of the output.
  - colors and bolds


Add subcommand to print and edit current config, maybe with Clap

## Some day
- plot weekly, monthly, yearly stats.


## Done

Read config options (such as the global constants) from a config file.
Show current work status. Sum and print all timestamps done today.
Files in current directory?
  - Progress bar
Let user decide to go against the rules if duration is too short.
Error: if there are no timestamps for a day, the code panics because it cannot subtract anything!!
