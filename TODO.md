## Todos
Improve error handling. No unwrap() or expects()!

Improve the looks of the output.
  - colors and bolds


## Some day
Improve code logic. Structs, enums?


## Done

Read config options (such as the global constants) from a config file.
Show current work status. Sum and print all timestamps done today.
Files in current directory?
  - Progress bar
Let user decide to go against the rules if duration is too short.
Error: if there are no timestamps for a day, the code panics because it cannot subtract anything!!
