# Rodomopo

An inverse po-mo-do-ro timer to track daily working time.

## Sales pitch
- Pomodoro timers are distracting when they go off. An inverse pomodoro just logs the time you have worked, provided that you have worked the minimum time.
- Set a minimum working session time and daily goal time for focused work, and use the computer to deal with it.

## Data directory
In Linux, the data is written to `/home/username/.rodomopo`.

Two files must be there for the app to work:
- `status.txt`: Contains the status of the current timestamp. Status can be either open or closed.
- Keeps track of historic timestamps in `timestamps.dat`.
